Several test tasks I completed at different times for various studios.

## RTS Build and Resources
A test task that required creating a prototype of a building system where structures produce and consume resources.
For production and resource exchange, buildings must be connected to others via a "bridge."

## TPS Character Animation
A test task that involved setting up a character animation system from scratch using provided animations. Additionally, it required configuring an IK system.
